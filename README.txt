The program tries to continue a given binary sequence.
Usage example:
    $ continue.py 01101
    01101 -> 1011011011
    with P = 0.052825


The Context-Tree Weighting (CTW) algorithm is used for the prediction.
The CTW prediction is optimal, if the next sequence bit depends
on the sequence suffix.
Note that CTW is encumbranced by patents.
