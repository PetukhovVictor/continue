An exploration of sequence prediction abilities.
Context-Tree Weighting (CTW) algorithm is used for the sequence prediction.
Note that CTW is encumbranced by patents.

The program tries to continue a given binary sequence.
Usage:
    $ continue.py 01101
    01101 -> 1011011011
    with P = 0.052825
